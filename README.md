# Personal webpage

[jstet.net]()

Built with [svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [bulma](https://bulma.io/), [lax](https://github.com/alexfoxy/lax.js) and [trianglify](https://github.com/qrohlf/trianglify). The coide is a bit messy. I first built the page without svelte and then migrated, so most of the javascript is vanilla.
